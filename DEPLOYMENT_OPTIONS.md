# Deployment Options for Backend

We've encountered issues deploying the backend to Vercel with CORS configuration. Here are several options you can try.

## Option 1: Use the Minimal CORS Test

The file `minimal_cors_test.js` is a bare-bones Express server with CORS enabled. This file is intentionally minimal to isolate CORS issues.

To try this option:
1. Rename `index.js` to `full_index.js`
2. Rename `minimal_cors_test.js` to `index.js`
3. Push the changes to Vercel
4. Test if CORS works with this simplified version

If it works, we can gradually add back the functionality from the full version.

## Option 2: Simplify Vercel Configuration

We've created a minimal `vercel.json` file that should definitely work. Try deploying with this simplified configuration file.

## Option 3: Create a New Vercel Project

Sometimes starting fresh is easiest:
1. Create a new repository with just the minimal files
2. Deploy that to a new Vercel project
3. Test if CORS works with a fresh deployment

## Option 4: Try a Different Hosting Provider

If Vercel continues to cause issues, consider:
- Render.com
- Railway.app
- Heroku
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Option 5: Use a CORS Proxy on the Frontend

As a last resort, you can use a CORS proxy on the frontend:
1. Install a CORS proxy package like 'cors-anywhere'
2. Set up the proxy on your frontend
3. Route API requests through the proxy

## Option 6: Remove all CORS configuration from backend code

In some cases, Vercel may handle CORS configuration better through their platform settings:
1. Remove all CORS handling from the backend code
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Configure CORS through the Vercel dashboard project settings

## Testing

The `test.html` file can be opened locally to test if your deployed API has CORS correctly configured.

## Most Reliable Solution

In our experience, Option 1 (minimal test) followed by Option 6 (platform CORS) is the most reliable approach.
